# Practice-and-Tutorials

This Repo contains several turorials that I've taken, mostly from TraversyMedia in Youtube.com.
I started to take this tutorias after graduating from the University of Texas at El Paso in May 17, 2020.
The reason for taking this tutorial was to learn something beyond school, they never taught us about web development and I 
always wanted to learn it.

In this tutorials you can find:
HTML tutorial
CSS tutorial
Flexbox tutorial
SASS tutorial
React tutorial

I will be taking more and more tutorials and create small projects on my own in my other repositories
